The samples were prepared from AL campaign as idicated in the file name date.  
Samples were stained with MC540 and analyzed in the plate reader  
Column 1 is the wavelength.  
columns 2-23 are absorbance in AU with decreasing concentration from 100% to 0% in 5% increments (column 2:100%, column 3: 95%...)
